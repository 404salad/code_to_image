# converting single file to image

vibe coded but hey it works  
the image format is VERY uncompressed (ppm: [netpbm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm))    
to run do `make` and `make run`  

## potential todos
- generate a real image format by implementing compression  
- break into multiple images if the image is too long   
- make the command a bit better
